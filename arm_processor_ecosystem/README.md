# Arm Processor Ecosystem
Infographic of ARM microarchitectures as tabulated on Wikepedia's [List_of_ARM_microarchitectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ARM_microarchitectures) combined with additional information from Wikepedia's [ARM_architecture_family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family)

## Arm Architecture Timeline
Over time the arm architecture has evolved to encorporate additional functionality to meet market needs

## All ARM processors
Every ARM processor is unique in some way, however compatability between instruction sets is most likley achieved when two processors are of the same _architecture_.
- Family: Processors of the same family were likley released at a simmilar time
- Architecture: Processors of the same architecture likley share many of the same assembly instructions if not all
- Profile: Gives information as to the probable use-case of the processor. (Classic, Real Time, Microcontroller, Application)
